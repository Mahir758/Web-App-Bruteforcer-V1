# Web-App-Bruteforcer-V1
This is the first of the many iterations of what will hopefully become an automatic and user-friendly bruteforcing tool for websites. This first version was intended to be used in a TryHackMe room called OWASP JuiceShop where I had the admin id and needed to find the right password which was a common password. 

The wordlist I used for the attack could be specified by me as I used sys.argv. 

## Usage ## 

$ python3 bruteforcerv1.py <wordlist_path> <url>
